# Naisargik and Inverse Naisargik Images in Error-Correcting Codes

## Overview
This document outlines the mathematical properties and applications of Naisargik and inverse Naisargik images in error-correcting codes, specifically focusing on VT (Vertical Redundancy Check) codes and Helberg codes. These codes are utilized for single error correction (VT) and multiple error correction (Helberg) scenarios.

## Description
- **VT Codes:** VT codes are proficient in single error correction. Naisargik images map quaternary ($\Z_4$) VT codes to binary ($\Z_2^2$) codes. The intersection of deletion spheres generated by two Naisargik images of VT codes implies identical weights.
- **Helberg Codes:** Helberg codes excel in multiple error correction. Naisargik images of quaternary Helberg codes can correct $s+1$ deletions, while inverse Naisargik images of binary Helberg codes correct $\lfloor\frac{s}{2}\rfloor$ errors. 

## Usage
- Researchers and practitioners interested in error-correction coding theory can refer to this paper for mathematical proofs and insights into the properties of Naisargik and inverse Naisargik images.
- Implementers of error-correcting codes can utilize these findings to enhance the robustness and efficiency of their systems, particularly in scenarios requiring single or multiple error correction.
